# CS50 Practice Repository (Personal Version)

This repository contains my own implementations inspired by CS50 problem sets.  
It is created **only for learning and practice**.

## Notes
- This is **not an official CS50 submission**
- It does **not strictly follow CS50 rules or style**
- Some solutions are modified or simplified
- Code may change as I learn and improve

## Purpose
- Practice C & programming
- Understand algorithms and memory concepts
- Learn by experimenting freely

## Disclaimer
If you are enrolled in CS50:
- Do **not** use this repository for submissions
- Attempt problems on your own first

This repository reflects my personal learning process.
